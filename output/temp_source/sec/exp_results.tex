\subsection{Results on TimePerceptBench}

Our experimental results are presented through four comprehensive tables in this section: Table~\ref{tab:baseline} reports baseline performance of all six models across nine temporal reasoning subtasks; Table~\ref{tab:finetuned} demonstrates fine-tuning results for the five open-source models after comprehensive fine-tuning; Table~\ref{tab:ucm} records visual recognition capabilities on the UCM dataset to demonstrate that temporal reasoning challenges are not due to visual encoding deficiencies; Table~\ref{tab:cross} details cross-dataset validation results on TemporalVQA, demonstrating the transferability of acquired temporal understanding capabilities.

\subsubsection{Baseline Performance}

Our evaluation reveals that unfine-tuned models demonstrate limited temporal reasoning capabilities on both TOU and TIU tasks, highlighting the challenges current multimodal large language models face in temporal understanding. Table~\ref{tab:baseline} presents comprehensive baseline results for all six evaluated models across nine temporal reasoning subtasks (five TOU tasks and four TIU tasks).

\end{table}

For TOU tasks, baseline models exhibit highly unbalanced performance distributions. In the TAL task, most models demonstrate capabilities significantly above random baseline, with Ovis achieving 85.0\% accuracy, and MiniCPM and MiMo-VL reaching 75.5\%, indicating that models possess fundamental capabilities for localizing specific anomalous frame positions within temporal sequences. However, in the more challenging ISR task, baseline models achieve PNR scores mostly close to 1.0, approaching random ordering levels, with InternVL at only 1.0202, indicating models struggle to infer complete temporal orders from visual observations. Notably, GPT-4o mini achieves a PNR of 0.3093 on the ISR task, significantly below 1.0, which may reflect systematic misunderstanding of the ordering direction in task instructions. In other judgment-based TOU subtasks, model performance slightly exceeds random baselines: SOV task accuracy ranges from 53.0\%--66.0\% (random baseline 50\%), POV task accuracy ranges from 45.5\%--58.5\% (random baseline 50\%), and TPL task accuracy ranges from 53.5\%--61.0\% (random baseline 50\%). These results indicate that while models can perform temporal judgments in simplified binary classification scenarios, their performance advantages remain relatively limited.

For TIU tasks, baseline performance reveals greater challenges in quantitative temporal reasoning. In the ICE task, model accuracy only slightly exceeds the 20\% random baseline, indicating models struggle to map visual changes to discrete time intervals. The EII task similarly shows limited performance, with model accuracies approaching the 25\% random baseline. Similar to ISR in TOU tasks, GPT-4o mini appears to misunderstand ordering direction in the IPR task's PNR scores in TIU, while other models similarly approach or fall slightly below random ordering. Model performance on the PIC task either slightly exceeds or falls slightly below random choice. These results indicate that without specific training, current multimodal large language models lack the ability to perform fine-grained temporal interval quantification from visual observations, with performance across all TIU subtasks clustering near random baselines.

\subsubsection{Fine-tuning Effects}

Fine-tuning on TimePerceptBench training data significantly enhances temporal reasoning capabilities, though improvement levels vary noticeably across different tasks. Table~\ref{tab:finetuned} presents fine-tuning results for five open-source models, demonstrating their learning capabilities on temporal reasoning tasks.

Qwen3-VL & 94.0\% & 4.2083 & 90.5\% & 78.5\% & 83.0\% & 29.0\% & 70.0\% & 1.2901 & 27.5\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For TOU tasks, fine-tuning produces significant improvements across all subtasks. Notably in the TAL task, the InternVL model's accuracy improves dramatically from 21\% to 77.0\%. While still exhibiting some gap compared to other models with accuracy above 90\%, the 56 percentage point improvement indicates that the fine-tuned model has fully grasped the core mechanisms of this task. In the ISR task, fine-tuning brings the most remarkable improvements, with all models' PNR substantially increasing to above 2.75, with Ovis reaching 4.3476, nearly tripling from its baseline of 1.1299, indicating models successfully learned the ability to infer complete temporal orders from visual cues. Other TOU subtasks similarly exhibit consistent improvement patterns: SOV task accuracy improves to 79.5\%--90.5\% (baseline 53.0\%--66.0\%), POV task accuracy improves to 65.5\%--78.5\% (baseline 45.5\%--58.5\%), and TPL task accuracy improves to 79.0\%--83.5\% (baseline 53.5\%--61.0\%). These results indicate that with targeted training, models can establish systematic understanding of temporal order, achieving significant performance leaps across multiple granularity levels.

In contrast, TIU tasks show more modest improvements after fine-tuning, revealing the inherent difficulty of quantitative temporal reasoning. In the ICE task, while all models achieve performance improvements, the improvement margins remain relatively limited, with accuracy improving from baseline 20.0\%--23.5\% to 26.5\%--31.5\%, with the best model MiMo-VL reaching 31.5\%, only an 8 percentage point improvement from its baseline of 23.5\%. This limited improvement suggests that mapping visual changes to absolute temporal scales remains a fundamental challenge, difficult to completely overcome even with specialized training. On the PIC task, fine-tuning effects are relatively more pronounced, with accuracy improving to 53.0\%--70.0\% (baseline 44.0\%--56.5\%), with Qwen3-VL reaching 70.0\%, a 13.5 percentage point improvement, indicating models possess stronger learning capabilities for relative temporal interval comparison. IPR task PNR scores improve to 1.29--2.16 (baseline 0.78--1.25); while improved, compared to the maximum PNR of 4.35 in the ISR task, ranking capability improvements in TIU tasks remain insufficient. In the EII task, accuracy improves from baseline 21.0\%--30.0\% to 27.5\%--34.0\%, with improvement margins of 4.5--7.5 percentage points, still significantly below ideal levels. These observations consistently indicate that TIU tasks, particularly those involving absolute temporal quantification (ICE and EII), pose more fundamental challenges to current model architectures.

Interestingly, we observe that baseline TOU and TIU performance are not perfectly correlated across different models. Models with stronger TOU baseline performance do not necessarily excel on TIU tasks, suggesting these capabilities may rely on partially independent cognitive mechanisms. Fine-tuning amplifies model-specific advantages while revealing systematic differences in temporal reasoning approaches across different architectures. Notably, GPT-4o mini, evaluated only in baseline configuration due to API limitations, exhibits performance levels comparable to open-source models, indicating that even advanced commercial models, when insufficiently large in scale and without task-specific fine-tuning, face fundamental challenges on certain temporal reasoning tasks.
