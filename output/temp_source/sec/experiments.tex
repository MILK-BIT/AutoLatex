\section{Experiments and Results}

We conducted comprehensive experiments on TimePerceptBench to systematically evaluate the temporal understanding capabilities of current state-of-the-art multimodal large language models. Our evaluation encompasses six representative models selected for their exceptional visual processing capabilities: GPT-4o mini and five advanced open-source models, including InternVL3.5-8B-Instruct, Ovis2.5-9B, Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct, MiniCPM-V-4.5, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL.
